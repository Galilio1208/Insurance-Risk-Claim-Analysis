## 🏢 Project Overview  

This project analyzes car insurance policyholder data to evaluate **risk exposure, claim behavior, and premium optimization strategies**.

The solution is built using **Power BI**, supported by structured domain documentation and business-oriented risk modeling.

The objective is to help insurance companies:

- Identify high-risk customers  
- Analyze claim frequency and severity  
- Optimize premium pricing  
- Improve underwriting decisions  
- Detect potential fraud patterns

## 🎯 Business Objectives  

- Segment customers based on demographic and vehicle risk factors  
- Evaluate claim frequency vs claim severity  
- Analyze geographic risk exposure  
- Assess vehicle-based risk patterns  
- Support risk-based premium pricing strategy

Each record represents an individual policyholder and contains:

### 👤 Customer Attributes
- Birthdate (Age Calculation)
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Parent Status
- Education

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Implemented  

- Total Claim Amount  
- Total Claims Filed  
- Average Claim Amount  
- Claim Frequency Rate  
- High-Risk Customer Identification  
- Claim Distribution by Vehicle Type  
- Claims by Coverage Zone

## 📈 Analytical Approach  

The dashboard focuses on two core insurance risk concepts:

### 🔁 Claim Frequency
How often a customer files claims.

### 💥 Claim Severity
How expensive those claims are.

By analyzing frequency vs severity, the project identifies:

- High-frequency low-cost customers  
- Low-frequency high-severity customers  
- High-risk segments needing premium adjustments
